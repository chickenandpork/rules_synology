# This set of functions allows generation of a file that carries port-config information to a
# conf/resource file.  From what I've seen, public-serving apps don't tend to use more than one or
# two, but that means we're doing an array anyhow, so we could create a very large config if
# necessary.
#
# Some functions may not be available at first release; I'm sorry if that blocks you in the
# short-term.  If you don't have time or feel uncomfortable submitting a PR, please submit a
# sanitized test-case so that a unittest can be built to represent what you need to be unblocked.

# The collation works as a series of configs:
