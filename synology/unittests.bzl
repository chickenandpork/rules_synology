# In order to check that a linked binary is truly cross-compiled to match the chosen platform, we do this in three steps:
# 1. create a template that confirms the result of a "file" command matches some static expression
# 2. create a template expansion that swaps in the static expression by platform
# 3. test that the result of the expanded template on the object file is the intended result

# that the given binary matches the target platform and is indeed cross-compiled
