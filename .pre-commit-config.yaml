# To install the dependencies for this file:
# 1) pip install pre-commit
#   (really, "sudo python3 -m pip install pre-commit")
#   (really, I've been carrying this boilerplate for years, but now it's all python3?)
#
# 2) pre-commit install --allow-missing-config
#
# yamllint checks this .pre-commit-config file as well
